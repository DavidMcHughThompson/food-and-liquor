#THIS IS THAT REAL STUFF

COMMENTS ON WORK
-I had trouble figuring out how to format the images and why certain things affected them as it did
-Also need to do some outside studying to make sure the semantic tags make sense in purpose and execution
-I do finally understand how inserting images and the assets folder work though, so that is a small victory
-I also need to practice more with github and the commands to push and all that stuff so that I know exactly what is happening when I execute them and why it needs to be that way. I need to learn the system mechanics there so I know it intuitively.
